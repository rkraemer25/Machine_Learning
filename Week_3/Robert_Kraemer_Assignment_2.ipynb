    "Data Exploration. Load the scikit-learn diabetes bunch object into a variable. Print out the description of the dataset. Load the diabetes features into a pandas dataframe with the proper column names. Add the target variable to this same dataframe. Run a command to look at the data types of your dataframe to see if there is any missing data. Perform descriptive statistics on the numeric columns of your dataframe. Plot histograms of your data to get a feel for each columnâ€™s distribution. Split your dataframe into a training and test set with 20% of your data being in the test set. Define a correlation matrix. Look at values highly correlated with the target. Plot the correlation matrix with a Seaborn heatmap. Use a Seaborn pairplot to look at the scatter plots of the three values with the highest target correlation. Prepare a feature set by dropping the target from your training dataframe. Copy your training target into a new dataframe."
